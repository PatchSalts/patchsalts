# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm a recent CS graduate from RIT looking to work with exciting hardware and software innovations. I have working knowledge of many programming languages like Java, Python, C#, SQL, Bash, assembly languages, and HTML, and I can learn anything you throw at me.

I also have a passion for skiing, learning Japanese, casual video games, and crochet.
